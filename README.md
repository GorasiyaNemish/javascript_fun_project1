# javascript_fun_project1

Here I made one small javascript project in which there is one rectangle if you hover rectangle at it's left side then it will change it's colour to red and if you hover rectangle at it's right part then it will change it's colour to blue.

It's RGB background colour will dynamically change as you move mouse on rectangle.
